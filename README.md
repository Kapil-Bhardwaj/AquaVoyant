Enlightening Rainfall Forecasting using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict rainfall using linear regression, a statistical technique that models the relationship between variables. By leveraging historical data on rainfall and relevant features such as temperature, humidity, and seasonality, this project seeks to forecast future rainfall patterns with accuracy.

## Features
• Utilizes linear regression to model the relationship between rainfall and relevant features <br>
• Handles historical data on rainfall and other environmental factors<br>
• Provides predictions of rainfall patterns for future time periods<br>
## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

• Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
• Install the necessary dependencies, such as Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.<br>
• Import the dataset into your project and perform any required preprocessing or feature engineering.<br>
• Run the linear regression model to train and make predictions on the rainfall data.<br>
## Dataset
• Dataset is taken from kegale.<br>
• Named - 'Austin_wheather'
## Data Cleaning
• Some column which are irrelevant to the prediction were removed and also those can create overfitting to our model were removed.
• Some Notation like 'T' i.e rainfall under 0.01 inch were made to '0' as anumerica value.
• Now the data set is ready to use.

## Results 
• Graphs were correctly plotted
Here are their representation.
